Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task also can take the information or change the value .

- an object is a series of variables and function 
that presents somthing.

-JavaScripts has several objects such as : String,Number,Math and date.
- Web browser implement objects can be used to create complex data sets.

- A conditinal statments says what to do in a given situation, it based in a consepts(if,else,then)
example:
if (mark>50){
Write ("you Passed");
}  else
{ write ("you fail");
}

 

- Evaluation of condition :
comparing between two values using a comparison operator  which returns a value of true or fulse.
- you can also multiple conditions by combining two or more comparision operators.
- the result will be bolean ( true or false).

(==) is equal to
this operator compares two values ( number,strings or bolean).
'hello'=='good bye'
the result is false 
 'hello'=='hello'
 this is true because they are the same.
 
(!=) is not equal to

'hello'!='good bye'
the result is true 
 'hello'!='hello'
 this is false because they are the same.
 
 (===) strict equal to
 
 
 JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays
var i;
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}


The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}


The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

Example
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
