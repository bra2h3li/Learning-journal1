What is the difference between an IDE and an editor?

Text Text Editors have a broader approach than IDE, IDEs usually combine code editors, debuggers, 
and built-in tools for compiling and running applications. An IDE is generally developed for a specific language. They are considered to be heavy than Text Editors as they come up with some built-in tools and plugins for that specific language. If an IDE is developed for 
a specific sector then you can’t use it for another totally different sector.

Conclusion:

So, if you asked me then I would suggest you to grab a Text Editor
because in a Text Editor you can switch between different sectors. For example, you can use
a text editor for a web-development as well as data science purpose. So you won’t be
bounded by limits. But in some cases, it is good to use an IDE. In the next blog, we would discover 
the best IDE and best Text Editor for python programming.
